How to code in Javascript

variables and Data:
    to create one use the function "var":
        for e.g. var alphabet = 12 / "hi" / true (integer, string, boolean);
        (you only need to use var when creating a variable not when reasigning it)
    Data types:
        booleans:
            A value which is either true or false
        Numbers:
            A single integer
        String:
            Somethhing inside quotes for e.g "hi bob"
    Incrementing and Decrementing:
        To increase a variables value by one then use ++ for example(var a = 0;   ++a;) a will be equall to 1
        to decrease a variables value by one do the same just using --
    Adding and Subtracting from variables:
        insted of doing x = x + 5 then you can do x += 5
        and for doing x = x - 5 you can do x -= 5
        and divide /=
        and times *=
    Undefined:
        this is what put in place of a variable if it is not assigned to Somethhing
    Null:
        this is when you want a varuable to be nothing you have to define null 
        for e.g var a = null;

Strings:
    Adding strings:
        to add two strings together use the add sign
        for e.g. var a = "bo"; var b = "b"; var c = a + b
        The result will be "bob" in one string
        remember it won't put a space between the strings so if a space is required you must put it in one of the strings
    Getting single characters:
        use the name of the list [] and then in the brackets put the position of the character 
        remember computers count from 0 so the 5th character would be [4] in the brackets
        you can also join this with the + sign and do list[1] + list2[2];


Booleans:
    Logic operators:
        &&:
            this checks if two values are true and returns a boolean value
        ||:
            this checks if one of the values are true and outputs a boolean 
            it will output true even if both values are true
        !:
            this reverses the boolean value of a variable
            for e.g. var a = true; var b = !a; document.write(b); output = false
        Javascript does && first so put || in brackets if you want to do || first
    Comparing Numbers:
        > , < , <= , >=:
            this will compare two numbers or variables and will output a boolean value
            for e.g.  var a = 24; var b = 26; a > b; output = false
            if it is the same number then it will return false unless if you use the <= or >= which will include 
            the same number as true
        ===:
            this ckecks if two numbers or variables are identical (number wise) it will return a boolean
        ==:
            refer book pg. 36

Arrays:
    To create an array:
        put the meat of the array in square brackets []
        you can put arrarys on not only one line for e.g.
        var a = [
            "hello",
            23,
            "sup",
        ]
    To get hold of a specific element:
        use the name of the array[] and put square brackets at the end of the name and then inside put the value of which
        element you want so for e.g. var a = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]; console.log(a[0]); output = [1]
        remember Javascript counts from 0!!!
    Changing an elements value:
        to change an ellements value do: var a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]; a[0] = 2; output = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
    Undefined ellement:
        to show that an ellement is undefined you can do: var a = [1, 2, undefined] 
    
Objects:
    What is an object:
        an object is allmost like a ddictionary in python
        it is a special type of array where you can have assigned value pairs
        for example to make one.  var a = {
                                        cat: "hello",
                                        dog: 23
                                  }
    Adding values:
        to add a value pair do the name of the object[the name of the value in quotes] = "the value of the key" 
    Combining arrays and objects:
        refere book pg. 69

Functions:    
    Printing:
        The ways to print:
            document.write();
            console.log();
            alert();
    strings:
        length of a string and an array:
         name of string .length;
         you can also do this with an array
        Getting specific parts of a string:
            name of string .slice( start character number, end character number)
            you can leave only one number in the brackets if you wnat the characters upto or from a certain character
            remember spaces count as characters
            for e.g.
            var a = "hello everybody"; a.slice(4, 15);
            output = "o everybody"
        String to upper case:
            name of string .toUpperCase();
            remember Js is case sensitive
        String to lower case:
            name of list .toLowerCase();
            remember Js is case sensitive
    Arrays:
        to find the length of an array:
            name of the array .length()
        to add an ellement to an arrray:
            name of array .push(what you wnat to go in the ellement)
        to add an ellement to the start of an array:
            name of array .unshift(what you wnat in the ellement)
        to remove the last ellement of an array:
            name of the array .pop()
        to remove an ellement from the beginning from an array:
            name of array .shift()
        to combine two arrays:
            use the name of one array .concat(and the name of the second array)
            the array in the brackets gets put behind the array before the dot
            if you wnat to add more than two arrays separaate the arrays with a comma in the brackets
        to get the positional number of an ellement:
            use the name of the array .indexOf(the ellement you wnat to find)
            for e.g. varv a = [1, 3, 6, 9, 3, 4]; a.indexOf(3); output = 1
            if there is no such ellement JS will output -1
            if the ellement has multiple places it will return the first position
        to put an array into a string:
            use the name of the array .join()
            if yiu leave the brackets empty it will put commas between the ellements
            but if you put something inside the brackets in a string it will replace the comma with whats in the string
            for e.g. var a = ["hi", 1]; a.join(" - "); output = "hi - 1"
    Objects:
        Accessing values:
            type the name of the object .the name of the value ()the name of the value is the value before the colon
        Accessing all the value names:
            Object.keys(the name of the object) this will print  out all the value keys
        Adding values in objects:
            the object name .the name of the value = the value itself in quotes
            for e.g. cat.bob = "no";

Loops:
    If loop:
        the most basic type of loop which checks if something is true
    If Else loop:
        an if loop but at the end does a loop for if the output is false
    Else If:
        type else if instead of elif in python
    While:
        executes the body untill the value is false

        1. // (for one line only)
        2. /* for multiple lines and */ to close

Maths:
    Maths Operating:
        + == plus
        - == minus
        / == divide
        * == times
        % == modulo (returns remainder)
        ** == to the power of x
        = == assigning equals
        == == same as
        != == not same as
        <= == smaller than and equall to
        >= == greater than and equall to
        < == less than
        > == greater than
    Random:
        Math.random():
            this picks a floating point number betwween o and 1
            you can on the right of the brackets put * and times it by as much as you want
            for e.g. var a = Math.random(); or var a = Math.random() * 9; <--- this picks a random floating point
            number between o and 9 
        Math.floor:
            rounds a number to the number below it
            for e.g. var a = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4); picks a random whole number between o and 1
        
Html:
    to embedd Javascript in Html:
        <html>
            <body>
            <script>
            //this is where Javascript will go
